#### Welcome to my E-Potfolio

My name is Beatrice Somuah, and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia. I am deeply passionate about leveraging forest carbon projects and nature-based solutions to address the pressing challenges of climate change.

With a strong background in geography and expertise in GIS, remote sensing, and data analysis, I am committed to driving sustainable environmental management practices. My goal is to contribute to building resilient ecosystems while promoting innovative strategies to mitigate the global impacts of climate change.
