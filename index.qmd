#### Welcome to my E-Potfolio

My name is Beatrice Somuah, a student at the University of British Columbia, reading masters in Geomatics for Environmental Management. I am very passionate about forest carbon projects and how we can use nature based solutions to reduce the impacts of climate change in the world.
